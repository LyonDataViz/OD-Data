column 9: The latitude of droping off points\
column 10: The longitude of droping off points\
column 11: The income of drive for this route\
column 12: Duration for this trajectory (minute)\
column 13: Condition of weather, 0 presents sunny, 1 presents shower and 2 presents rainy\
column 14: The time slot of dropoff points\
column 15: Distance of this trajectory\
columne 16: Average speed for this distance between pickup points and dropoff points
